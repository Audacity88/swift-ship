Essential information you''ll need:
- Package dimensions (length, width, height)
- Accurate weight
- Complete sender and recipient addresses
- Description of contents

### Packaging Guidelines

Proper packaging is crucial for ensuring your items arrive safely at their destination. Use appropriate boxes or envelopes that can adequately protect your items during transit.

Proper packaging is essential for ensuring your items arrive safely at their destination. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the best practices for packaging different types of items, selecting appropriate materials, and preparing your shipments for safe transit.

## Understanding Packaging Basics

The key to successful shipping lies in understanding that proper packaging serves multiple purposes. It protects your items from damage, prevents harm to other packages in transit, and ensures efficient handling throughout the shipping process. Good packaging maintains the integrity of your items while optimizing shipping costs through appropriate size and weight management.

## Choosing the Right Box

Selecting the appropriate box is crucial for protecting your items and managing shipping costs effectively.

- **Special Handling**: Custom crating for extremely heavy or large items

## Proper Packing Techniques

### Internal Packaging

Creating proper internal packaging is crucial for item protection:

1. **Bottom Layer**

   - Ensure even distribution of cushioning material

2. **Item Wrapping**

   - Seal all wrapping securely with tape
   - Add extra protection for corners and edges

3. **Void Fill**
   - Fill all empty spaces completely
   - Use appropriate void fill material
   - Ensure items cannot shift during transit

### Special Considerations

Different items require specific packaging approaches:

3. Ensure 2-3 inch tape overlap on all seams
4. Remove or cover old labels and markings

### Label Placement

Proper label placement ensures efficient handling:
- Place shipping label on largest surface
- Ensure all barcodes are flat and scannable
- Add duplicate label inside package
- Include return address on opposite side

## Weight and Size Considerations

### Weight Distribution

Proper weight distribution prevents damage and ensures safe handling:
- Center heavy items in the box
- Distribute weight evenly across the bottom
- Keep center of gravity low
- Consider package orientation during transit

### Size Optimization

Optimize your package size to minimize shipping costs:
